Frame Grabber Software-UGrab Main Features

1. Bring-up Configuration

   - Scan-Device: This feature allows users to select the device model and scan to identify the equipment list. Users can select the channel to run in the device list.

   - Deserializer Configuration: Users can select the correct profile from the configuration list, read image parameter information, and ensure the correct output format is chosen according to the camera type.

   - Register Configuration: Depending on the selected camera module, this feature loads the register configuration. Users can insert, delete, or export registers and modify register information.

   - Module Configuration:  Displays the register configuration based on the selected profile. Users can modify the configuration and save changes.

   - Load and Launch: After selecting the channel and corresponding module configuration, users can click “Load and Launch” to start the video stream.


2. Working Condition Detection

   - Electrical Characteristic Test: Provides alarm information based on preset voltage and current thresholds, and allows users to export warning parameters and reset them.

   - Video Frame Detection: Offers early warning information based on preset frame rate statistics error rate parameters. Displays messages for frame rate detection, frame loss, and frame error.


3. Functional Configuration

   - Interface Configuration: Configures the POC voltage according to module hardware parameters.

   - Test Plan (Beta version): Runs UGrab automatically for testing based on set parameters.

   - I2C Read and Write: Allows users to read and write I2C, debug relevant functions, and select the corresponding I2C device node.

   - Save Image Config: Users can set the format and number of images to be saved and click “Save Image” to save the current frame.


4. Log Management

   - Provides UGrab log information to assist in debugging and retrieval of exceptions.


5. Technical Support

   - Displays relevant information about the UGrab version and provides contact details for further assistance.
